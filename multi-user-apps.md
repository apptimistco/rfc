## Multi-User Apps ##
This RFC describes how Apptimist-Apps support multiple users on a shared device.

**Status:** Postpone
Apple is rumored to be preparing multi-user support in response to the equivalent Anroid feature.

#### Sign-in Screen(s) ####
The initial sign-in screen has the App's logo background image and a button overlay for "*new*" Facebook login.
<!-- initial sign-in image here -->
On subsequent sign-in, the app logo is replaced with the Facebook profile image of the last App user along with "*sign-in*" and "*new*" Facebook.
<!-- profile sign-in image here -->
If more the App has had more than one user on that device, the sign-in screen includes an overlay message instructing one to swipe to other users.
<!-- swipe-to-profile image here -->
#### Sign-out Screen ####
After selecting the ;power& button, the App shows a sign-out screen consisting of the users profile background image along with "*confirm*", "*cancel*", and "*forget me*" buttons. The later results in all deletion of the user's data before exiting the App and their profile won't appear in the sign-in.
